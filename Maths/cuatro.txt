4. when we have a simple division but not exact, adding decinals to the
result

Let's take as an example this division: 123/2
We do the division in the normal way, until we reach the end of the
dividend and we see that the final remainder is not 0.

Here, we add a 0 to the remainder that we have left. In this case it is 1,
putting a 0 to the right becomes a 10. With this number we
keep doing the division and add new digits to the result.
Before this, you have to put a decimal point aligned with the last
remainder (in this case the 1) that we obtained, or aligned with the final "original"
of the division, before putting a 0 to the remainder.

The division is finished until the final remainder is 0, or until you have
a result with the number of decimal places you want. The result of
123/2 is 61.5
