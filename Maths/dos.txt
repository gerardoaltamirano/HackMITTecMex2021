2. When we have the decimal point in the divisor

The divisor refers to the numbers outside the "little house", which
you have to do is locate the decimal point there and count how many
spaces are missing to become an "integer" number. Is the same
to count the spaces to the right of the period.
Let's take this division as an example: 377 รท 2.6. In this case, for the
the divisor "2.6", there is 1 space to the right of the period.

When you have counted these spaces, this is the number of zeros
that you will need to add to the dividend before you can do the division.
In this example, instead of 377 / 2.6, you will have 3770/26.

You have to do the division with these numbers, 3770/26.
The result gives 145 as is, it is not necessary to modify it in any way,
but the divider remains as it was originally. The result of 377 / 2.6
is 145.

We can check the result by multiplying this result by
the divisor, and this operation should give us the dividend.
By multiplying 145 x 2.6, what it gives us is 377, making it our
result is correct.
