Crossed multiplication

This method consists of multiplying the numerator of the first fraction
by the denominator of the second fraction and place the result in the
numerator of the final fraction. On the other hand, we have to multiply
the denominator of the first fraction times the numerator of the second
fraction and we write the result in the denominator of the final fraction.

Example:
(2/3) / (7/5)

We multiply the numerator of the first fraction by the denominator of the
second fraction:
2 * 5 = 10

We multiply the denominator of the first fraction by the numerator of the
second fraction:
3 * 7 = 21

To determine the correct result, we place the result of the first
multiplication in the numerator of the final fraction and the result of the
second multiplication in the denominator of the final fraction:
(2/3) / (7/5) = 10/21
