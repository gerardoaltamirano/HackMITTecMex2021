Bloody Math, son!

Welcome to the "Divisions with decimal point" menu

Ready to learn how to divide with a decimal point?
Let us begin!

NOTE: Remember that when we write a division like this: "7/2" or
"7 รท 2", this is the same as writing the division with the 7 (dividend)
inside the box or galley (what we know as the "little house"),
and the 2 (which is the divisor) outside of it.

It is useful to classify these divisions in four different cases:

1. When we have the decimal point in the dividend

2. When we have the decimal point in the divisor

3. When there is a decimal point in the dividend and in the divisor

4. When originally we had a simple division, but it is not exact,
and we want to add decimals to the result.
