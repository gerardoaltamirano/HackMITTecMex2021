3. When there is a decimal point in the dividend and in the divisor

This is kind of a mix of division with the point in the dividend
and with dot on the divider. What you have to do is see how many spaces
there is to the right of the decimal point of the divisor, that is, the number is that
It is outside the "little house". We will use the example of 224.44 / 6.2


By doing this of the spaces it is as if we "remove" the point of the divisor.
We know that there was a space to the right of this point in 6.2, so
you also have to move the point of the dividend the same number of spaces
that we said before.
If there were two spaces to the right of the point of the divisor, we move the point
of the dividend two spaces as well.
However, in this case there was 1 space, so we move the point of the
divider 1 place to the right. It would fit us like 2244.4 / 62

Now you can do this division as a division only with point in the
dividend (see case 1).


Our result is 36.2, but our divisor is the original (6.2), and the
dividend also remains as it was originally (224.44).
We can check multiplying the result by the divisor and see that we
gives the dividend correctly.
Therefore, the result of dividing 224.44 / 6.2 = 36.2
