1. When we have the decimal point in the dividend

Here the decimal point is in the dividend, that is, the numbers
inside the "little house". For example, 674.1 has a decimal point
and we divide it by 7, that is, it is 674.1 / 7.

In this case, you have to do the division
as a simple division, ignoring the period. Pretend
which is not.

When you're done, just raise the decimal point to your result,
you line it up where it belongs. The result of 674.1 รท 7 is 96.3.
