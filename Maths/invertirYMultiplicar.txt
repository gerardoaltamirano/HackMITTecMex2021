Invert and multiply

This method consists of inverting the SECOND FRACTION, that is, changing
the denominator for the numerator and change the numerator for the denominator.
Then the two fractions are multiplied.
Remember that to multiply fractions it is done online: Numerator by
numerator and denominator by denominator.

Example:
(2/3) / (7/5)

We invert the second fraction and the first remains the same:
(2/3) * (5/7)

We multiply numerator by numerator:
2 * 5 = 10

We multiply denominator by denominator:
3 * 7 = 21

To determine the correct result, we place the result of the first
multiplication in the numerator of the final fraction and the result of the
second multiplication in the denominator of the final fraction:
(2/3) / (5/7) = 10/21
