# HackMITTecMex2021
We are an enthusiastic team enrolled in our first Hackathon, undergrads from Mexico City pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Nanotechnology Engineering and in Computer Science.

We have decided to develop three projects for this hackathon, which are:


1. IBM Delivery Pool- A specialized software which seeks to diminish what we call empty trucks, bring safer and more sustainable routes for our clients, but also to become a close hand for local businesses that lack of extensive logistics. This through the usage of IBM tools such as Weather Routing Logistics and Environmental Intelligence Suite in general. We also utilize a Node-Red Code which allows us to connect our networks with the Weather IBM tool. We are truly looking forward to keep this project on track and deliver it to our potential customers.

2. Educational Games- As mexicans, we live in a country with a tremendous lack of high-quality educational tools. With these friendly and straightforward games students from any school grade to take their potential even further. Here, we designed two Python games, maths and spelling trainers, in which the students are taken to their best version of themselves by answering to our tasks. This was long-time programming, but we are pretty sure that, with time, help and the correct resources, educational problems will be tackled the right way.

3. Science linkers- The main goal of this proposal is mainly to connect but also visualize autistic youngsters through some sort of science fairs where, designed by Engineering or any other career Student Association, they can gather and organize a rally but at the same time being observed by companies which later on, will offer some internships and fellowships according to the extent of their capabilities.
