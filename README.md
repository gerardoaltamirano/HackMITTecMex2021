# HackMITTecMex2021
We are an enthusiastic team enrolled in out first Hackathon, students frim Mexico City coursing a current Bachelor in Science in Nanotechnology Engineering and also in Computer Sciences.

We have decided to develop three projects for this hackathon, which are:

IBM Delivery Pool- A specialized software which seeks to diminish what we call empty trucks, bring safer and more sustainable routes for our clients, but also to become a close hand for local businesses that lack of extensive logistics.
